# Key-logger
A python script that logs all keyboard inputs and stores them in a document

# How It Works
The 'script.py' file is what records the key strokes using the public pynput project located here:
https://pypi.org/project/pynput/

Upon running the script, a menu is prompted giving the user options for what to do. They can record key strokes, view the previously recorded key strokes or erase previously recorded key strokes.

#My Experience
I haven't worked with python much or with public python projects such as mynput, but I learned a lot from this mini-project. I added colors to text in the program for aesthetics, and am proud of how it turned out.
